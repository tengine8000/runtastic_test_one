## üíº &nbsp; About Runtastic_THT 1


 Create a RESTful stand alone web application that is able to persist collections of GPS points (collection in JSON format). These collections are called traces. You can download sample traces from here.

Keep in mind that this web application should work for a large amount of users and that it is likely to receive about 10 times more read than write requests.

 Then test all the existing endpoints using ```curl```, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [REST Client plugin](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="20px" />

##### **Using Curl**
- ```$ curl -i -X PUT -d @/tmp/trace1.json http://localhost:3003/traces/1 ```

- ```$ curl -i -X POST -d @/tmp/trace1.json http://localhost:3003/traces```


##### **Using REST Client plugin**

This is a lot easier and more fun.

Go to the ```test.http``` file at the root of the project, and if you have the plugin installed, you will see the ```Send Request``` links above each of the sample request I created in the file for tests.

You can edit and click each of the requests to see the responses.
